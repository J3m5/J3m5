## ✨ Principles
- Clean, well-typed code that scales with the team.
- Performance first: from build to runtime.
- Beautiful UI/UX that respects accessibility and motion.
- Minimal, maintainable patterns — prefer readability and correctness.

## 🧰 How I usually work
- TypeScript-first front‑end architecture (React / Vue).
- Component-driven design with TailwindCSS and atomic styles.
- Remote-first collaboration, code reviews, and pairing.
- Containerized local dev with Docker for reproducible environments.
- Use TanStack Query for robust data fetching patterns.
